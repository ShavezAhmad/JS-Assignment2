<h1>FUNCTION HANDSON</h1>
    <pre>
<p>Q1) Create one function with zero parameter having a console statement
A1) function hello(){
    console.log("Hello World!")
    }
    hello();
<p class="op">O/P -> "Hello World!</p>

<hr>

Q2) Create one function which takes two values as a parameter and print the sum of them as "Sum of 3, 4 is 7"
A2) function add(a,b){
    s=a+b;
    return s;
    }
    console.log(`Sum of of 3, 4 is ${add(3,4)}`)
<p class="op">O/P -> Addition of 2 and 3 = 5</p>

<hr>

Q3) Create one arrow function
A3) const mul=(a,b)=>{
    m=a*b;
    return m;
    }
    console.log(`Multiplication of 3, 4 is ${mul(3,4)}`)
<p class="op">O/P -> Multiplication of 3,4 is 12</p>

<hr>

Q4)Print output: 
    var x = 21;
    var girl = function () {
        console.log(x);
        var x = 20;
    };
    girl ();

<p class="op">O/P -> undefined</p>
<p>Explanation - It is undefined because the variable in the function is not hoisted. When the function is executed it checks that
              there is a local variable x is declared after the console statement.</p>

<hr>

Q5) Print output: 
var x = 21;
girl ();
console.log(x)
function girl() {
    console.log(x);
    var x = 20;
}; 

<p class="op">O/P -> Undefined<br>       21</p>
<p>Explanaton - First the function is executed and the first console.log() is executed the output will be undefined because the
             variable in the function is not hoisted. There is local variable x declared as var. After the function is executed
             again the second console.log() is executed and this time it prints the value of x as 21 because it has global scope.
    </p>

<hr>

Q6)Print output: 
var x = 21;
a();
b();

function a(){
    x=20;
    console.log(x);
}
function b(){
    x=40;
    console.log(x);
}
console.log(x);

<p class="op">O/P -> 20<br>       40<br>       40</p>
<p>Explanation - First the variable x is globally declared as var and then the function a() is called and again the variable is 
              reinitialised as 20 because it doesn't have any datatype and bydefault it will have the properties of var and then 
              it prints the value 20. Now,the function b() is called agian the variable is reinitialised as 40 because it doesn't 
              have any datatype and bydefault it will have the properties of var and then it prints the value 40. At last,
              console.log() after both functions is executed and print the value of global x as 40. 
</p>

<hr>

Q7) Write a function that accepts parameter n and returns factorial of n
var n=5;
console.log(`Factorial of ${n} is ${fact(n)}`);
fact(n)
function fact(n)
{
    let f=1;
    for(let i=1;i<=n;i++){
        f=f*i;
    }
    return f;
}

<p class="op">O/P -> Factorial of 5 is 120</p>
<hr>
</p></pre>
<h1>DAY 2</h1>
<pre>
Q1) Guess the Output

function FindSum(a, b){
    return a + b;
}

function DisplayData(data, batch){
    console.log(`i am from ${data} and My batch is EA${batch}`)
}

DisplayData("PrepBytes", FindSum(20, 3));

<p class="op">O/P -> i am from PrepBytes and My batch is EA23</p>
<P>Explanation - First the function "DisplayData(data, batch)" is called which has 2 parameters, first one is a string and second one 
              is a callback function "FindSum(20,3)" which is executed first and it returns the value as 23 and then the function 
              DisplayData is executed and then it prints the statements in console.log().
</P>

<hr>

Q2) Guess the output

Abc();
const Abc = function(){
    let value = 20;
    console.log(value);
}

<p class="op">O/P -> caught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'Abc' before initialization</p>
<p>Explanation - Because we need to call the anonymous function later, with the assigned name "Abc"</p>

<hr>

Q3) Guess the output

var a = 10;
(function (){
    console.log(a);
    var a = 20;
})
();

<p class="op">O/P -> undefined</p>
<p>Explanaton - First the variable a is globally declared as var and then the function is executed and in the fucntion first
             console.log() is executed before the locally variable a is declared as var. The output will be undefined because the 
             variable in the function is not hoisted.</p>
 
<hr>

Q4) Guess the Output
const greet =  function(name){
    return function(m){
    
        console.log(`Hi!! ${name}, ${m}`);
    }
}
  
const greet_message = greet('EA19');
greet_message("Welcome To PrepBytes")

<p class="op">O/P -> Hi!! EA19, Welcome To PrepBytes</p>
<p>Explanation - Here the 'greet' variable stores a the value return by a high order function and calling it with another name
              'greet_message' which returns another function and console.log() is executed. </p>
